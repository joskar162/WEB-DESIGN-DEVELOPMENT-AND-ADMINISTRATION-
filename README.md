## 🎯 What you'll learn

These examples cover essential HTML concepts including:

- **Document structure:** Proper use of `<!doctype html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.
- **Text formatting:** Headings (`<h1>`–`<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), bold (`<B>` / recommended `<strong>`), italics (`<I>` / recommended `<em>`), preformatted text (`<pre>`), and horizontal rules (`<hr>`).
- **Lists:** Unordered (`<ul>`), ordered (`<ol>`), and definition lists (`<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>`).
- **Links:** Internal page anchors (`<a href="#section">`), inter-page links (`<a href="page.html#section">`), and external links.
- **Media:** Images (`<img>`), figures (`<figure>` / `<figcaption>`).
- **Tables:** Structured data with `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`.
- **Forms:** Accessible form controls with `<label>` and `<input>`.
- **HTML comments:** How to add notes in your code (`<!-- -->`).
- **Interactive elements:** A small inline SVG and a tiny JavaScript snippet that updates the UI.

## 🚀 Getting started

- **Open files:** Double-click any `.html` file (e.g., `format.html`, `index.html`, `start.html`) in your file explorer to launch it in your default web browser.
- **Command line:** Use PowerShell commands like:

```powershell
Start-Process .\format.html
# or
Start-Process .\index.html
```

- **Editing:** Right-click any file and select "Open with > Notepad" or open Notepad first and use File → Open to edit.

## 💡 Tips for success

- The `start.html` file uses uppercase tags `<B>` and `<I>` to match the Notepad exercise style. For modern HTML, prefer lowercase semantic tags like `<strong>` and `<em>` for better accessibility and meaning.
- After editing, save your changes and refresh your browser to see updates.
- Use browser developer tools (F12) to inspect elements, debug, and experiment with styles.

---

## 🌱 Next steps

- Practice replacing `<B>` and `<I>` with `<strong>` and `<em>` in `start.html`.
- Add more form controls such as radio buttons, select dropdowns, and textareas with validation.
- Make `html_basics.html` responsive using CSS media queries.
- Separate JavaScript into an external `main.js` file and link it properly.
